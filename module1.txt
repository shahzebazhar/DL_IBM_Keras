--NEURONS AND NEURAL NETWORKS

-Neural networks are based on neurons and how they function in our brain.
-Santiago Ramon 1899 drew the first image of neurons by using a pigeon brain. Father of Modern Neuroscience.
-One big body in a neuron that branch out to connect to other neurons
-Main body called 'soma', contains the nucleas of the neuron
-Dendrites, small arms sticking out of body.
-Axon are the arms that stick out and connect to other bodies.
-The whiskers at the end of the axons are called terminal buttons or Synapse.

-Dendrites recieve information
-Soma processes the information
-Axon takes the processed data from Soma and move it to the Synapse
-Synapse connect to other dendrites of other somas.
-Learning occurs by activating certain neural networks repeatedly.
-Makes them more likely to produce the desired outcome.

--ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS

-For a network, we divide the neurons into different layers.
-First layer that provides the input: Input Layer.
-Final layer giving the output: Output Layer.
-Any set of nodes in between the input and output layers are called the Hidden Layers(These can be multiple).
-Three main topics of neural networks, Forward Propagation, Backpropagation, Activation functions.

-Forward Propagation
-Each dendrite has a weight by which they are determined in soma.
-Neuron processes the information from dendrites by producing a weighted sum.
-A constant in added to it called the 'bias'.
-We further map the neural sum to a non linear space(such as applying sigmoid function to it).

-Activation Functions
-Non linear transformations like sigmoid function is called activation functions.
-These functions decide whether a neuron should be activated or not(aka is the information relevant or not).
-A neural network without an activation is just a linear regression model.

-The weight on each dendrite and bias is calculated by the network.
-An input given can be chained over multiple neurons, if 2 neurons are connected, the input given to the first neuron has the output recieved after the last neuron processes the information.
